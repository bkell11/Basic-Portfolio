            <p>My name is Blake Keller.  I am married to my beautiful wife Jordyn.  We have two toy australian shepherds, a boy named Vader and a girl named Cinnamon.  They are pretty much our kids and we would do anything for them.</p>
            <p>I attended Weber State University to play college football for the Wildcats.  I received my bachelor's degree in Electronic Media Communications.  I originally wanted to get into sports broadcasting, but my life just ended up taking me in a different direction.</p>
            <p>For the last 5 years I have been working for Federal Express.  I started out in customer service and have since become a driver for them, which I much prefer.  During the fall the last 5 years, I have also coached football at Herriman High School. We won the 5a state championship in 2015.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this year I am not going to continue to coach.  I have decided to take up this bootcamp class in order to change careers and have more opportunities.  I have two friends who work in the computer programming field and I can't wait to join them.</p>
